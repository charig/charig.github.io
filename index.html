	  <h3>I'm <strong>{{ site.author }}</strong>. I am currently a member of the <a href="https://prl-prg.github.io/index.html">prl-prg</a> lab as a post-doctoral researcher. 
			In Prague I am mainly working on a compiler for optimizing the R programming language.
		To do so, we are exploring a combination of static analysis and speculative techniques.</h3> 
		<h3>My main research interest aims at making programming languages more flexible to help unleash developers creativity. 
			I am also interested in ensuring that applications in these programming languages do not suffer from performance overheads due to their increased flexibility. 
			Moreover, I am interested in providing mechanism to help developers to enforce that applications written in these languages behaves correctly.<h3>
		<h3>
			I am a former member of the <a href="http://lafhis.dc.uba.ar/en">LaFHIS</a> lab in Argentina. 
			My PhD. was mainly about reflective virtual machines. 
			<a href="http://lafhis.dc.uba.ar/en/~diegog">Diego Garbervetsky</a> was my advisor 
			and <a href="http://stefan-marr.de/research/">Stefan Marr</a> collaborated a lot in the whole process.
			I also closely collaborated with the <a href="https://rmod.inria.fr">RMoD</a> team from INRIA, Lille, France. 
		</h3>
		<h3>
			Finally, I did some work also with Operating Systems. My master thesis was a contribution to the SqueakNOS project and I'm still involved on it.
